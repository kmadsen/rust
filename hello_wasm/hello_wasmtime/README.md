Getting more involved. The book has a couple walk throughs.

I've added a Makefile to the markdown_parser example which should
help run the examples without reading the book.

Checkpoint: I did not go deep into the "Embedding in Rust" examples. It looks like you
can execute wasm libraries directly from wasm. Interesting, but I think there
is more useful information to learn in https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/.
I may come back to this.
