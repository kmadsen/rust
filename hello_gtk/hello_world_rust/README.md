## About

https://gtk-rs.org

Setting up GUI environment with Rust and GTK 4.

This app is pretty basic. Shows how to create a window and apply some of the css styles. It follows the book https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/introduction.html.

I didn't use the Interface Builder because I'd prefer building all of the ui with code, rather than parsing files.

## Running

``` sh
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```
