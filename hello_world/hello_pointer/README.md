Reading about how references, pointers, and smart pointers work in rust.

For further reading, there is https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html

## Example on fmt

```
$ cargo fmt
```

There is a good integration tool with vscode and rustfmt. In your cargo package
you can specify a rustfmt.toml|.rustfmt.toml file. vscode reads it and applies
the formatting rules to your editor. Very simple!
